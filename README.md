# Flask_Project01
In this project, we have developed a simple web application using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web application has several pages, including a home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, and dashboard page. We used an Excel file as a database to store user information, and implemented user authentication and authorization using session management. Overall, this project provides a good introduction to building web applications with Flask and basic web development technologies.
